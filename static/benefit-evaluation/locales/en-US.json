Instead of assuming that gains and costs occur immediately, predefined distribution profiles are used to show how value creation and expenses are distributed throughout the project's lifetime. By using such profiles, one can estimate the total benefit and cost for each Epic, and then calculate indicators such as Net Present Value (NPV) and Accumulated NPV. This provides a holistic basis for assessing economic value and risk over time."
